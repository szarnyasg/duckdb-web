You can browse the DuckDB documentation offline in two formats:

* As a [single PDF file for v1.0.0](https://blobs.duckdb.org/docs/duckdb-docs-1.0.0.pdf) (approx. 4 MB)

* As a [website packaged in a single ZIP file containing all versions](/duckdb-docs.zip) (approx. 50 MB). To browse the website locally, decompress the package, navigate to the `duckdb-docs` directory, and run:

  ```bash
  python -m http.server
  ```

    Then, connect to <http://localhost:8000/>.
