## Introduction

The Netherlands, the birthplace of DuckDB, has an area of about 42,000&nbsp;km² with a population of about 18 million people.
The high density of the country is a key factor in its [extensive railway network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport_in_the_Netherlands),
which consists of 3,223 km of tracks and 397 stations.

Information about this network's stations and services is available in the form of [open datasets](https://www.rijdendetreinen.nl/en/open-data/).
These high-quality datasets are maintained by the team behind the [Rijden de Treinen _(Are the trains running?)_ application](https://www.rijdendetreinen.nl/en/about).

In this post, we'll demonstrate some of DuckDB's analytical capabilities on the Dutch railway network dataset.
Unlike most of our other blog posts, this one doesn't introduce a new feature or release: instead, it demonstrates several existing features using a single domain.
Some of the queries explained in this blog post are shown in simplified form on [DuckDB's landing page](/).

## Loading the Data

For our initial queries, we'll use the 2023 [railway services dataset](https://www.rijdendetreinen.nl/en/open-data/train-archive).
To get this dataset, download the [`services-2023.csv.gz` file](https://blobs.duckdb.org/nl-railway/services-2023.csv.gz) (330 MB) and load it into DuckDB.

First, start the [DuckDB command line client]({% link docs/api/cli/overview.md %}) on a persistent database:

```bash
duckdb railway.db
```

Then, load the `services-2023.csv.gz` file into the `services` table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE services AS
    FROM 'services-2023.csv.gz';
```

Despite the seemingly simple query, there is quite a lot going on here.
Let's deconstruct the query:

* First, there is no need to explicitly define a schema for our `services` table, nor is it necessary to use a [`COPY ... FROM` statement]({% link docs/sql/statements/copy.md %}#copy--from).
DuckDB automatically detects that the `'services-2023.csv.gz'` refers to a gzip-compressed CSV file, so it calls the [`read_csv` function]({% link docs/data/csv/overview.md %}#csv-functions),
which decompresses the file and infers its schema from its content using the [CSV sniffer]({% link docs/data/csv/auto_detection.md %}).

* Second, the query makes use of DuckDB's [`FROM`-first syntax]({% link docs/sql/query_syntax/from.md %}#from-first-syntax), which allows users to omit the `SELECT *` clause.
Hence, the SQL statement `FROM 'services-2023.csv.gz';` is a shorthand for `SELECT * FROM 'services-2023.csv.gz';`.

* Third, the query creates a table called `services` and populates it with the result from the CSV reader. This is achieved using a [`CREATE TABLE ... AS` statement]({% link docs/sql/statements/create_table.md %}#create-table--as-select-ctas).

Using [DuckDB v0.10.3]({% link docs/installation/index.html %}), loading the dataset takes approximately 5&nbsp;seconds on an M2 MacBook Pro. To check the amount of data loaded, we can run the following query which [pretty-prints]({% link docs/sql/functions/char.md %}#print-numbers-with-thousand-separators) the number of rows in the `services` table:

```sql
SELECT format('{:,}', count(*)) AS num_services
FROM services;
```

| num_services |
|-------------:|
| 21,239,393   |

We can see that more than 21&nbsp;million train services ran in the Netherlands in 2023.

## Finding the Busiest Station per Month

Let's ask a simple query first: _What were the busiest railway stations in the Netherlands in the first 6 months of 2023?_

First, for every month, let's compute the number of services passing through each station.
To do so, we extract the month from the service's date using the [`month` function]({% link docs/sql/functions/datepart.md %}#monthdate),
then perform a group-by aggregation with a `count(*)`:

```sql
SELECT
    month("Service:Date") AS month,
    "Stop:Station name" AS station,
    count(*) AS num_services
FROM services
GROUP BY month, station
LIMIT 5;
```

Note that this query showcases a common redundancy in SQL: we list the names of non-aggregated columns in both the `SELECT` and the `GROUP BY` clauses.
Using DuckDB's [`GROUP BY ALL` feature]({% link docs/sql/query_syntax/groupby.md %}#group-by-all), we can eliminate this.
At the same time, let's also turn this result into an intermediate table called `services_per_month` using a `CREATE TABLE ...  AS` statement:

```sql
CREATE TABLE services_per_month AS
    SELECT
        month("Service:Date") AS month,
        "Stop:Station name" AS station,
        count(*) AS num_services
    FROM services
    GROUP BY ALL;
```

To answer the question, we can use the [`arg_max(arg, val)` aggregation function]({% link docs/sql/functions/aggregates.md %}#arg_maxarg-val),
which returns the column `arg` in the row with the maximum value `val`.
We filter on the month and return the results:

```sql
SELECT
    month,
    arg_max(station, num_services) AS station,
    max(num_services) AS num_services
FROM services_per_month
WHERE month <= 6
GROUP BY ALL;
```

| month |      station       | num_services |
|------:|--------------------|-------------:|
| 1     | Utrecht Centraal   | 34760        |
| 2     | Utrecht Centraal   | 32300        |
| 3     | Utrecht Centraal   | 37386        |
| 4     | Amsterdam Centraal | 33426        |
| 5     | Utrecht Centraal   | 35383        |
| 6     | Utrecht Centraal   | 35632        |

Maybe surprisingly, in most months, the busiest railway station is not in Amsterdam but in the country's 4th largest city, [Utrecht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utrecht), thanks to its central geographic location.

## Finding the Top-3 Busiest Stations for Each Summer Month

Let's change the question to: _Which are the top-3 busiest stations for each summer month?_
The `arg_max()` function only helps us find the top-1 value but it is not sufficient for finding top-k results.
Luckily, DuckDB has extensive support for SQL features, including [window functions]({% link docs/sql/functions/window_functions.md %}) and we can use the [`rank()` function]({% link docs/sql/functions/window_functions.md %}#rank) to find top-k values.
Addtionally, we use [`make_date`]({% link docs/sql/functions/date.md %}#make_dateyear-month-day) to reconstruct the date, [`strftime`]({% link docs/sql/functions/timestamptz.md %}#strftimetimestamptz-format) to turn it into the month's name and [`array_agg`]({% link docs/sql/functions/aggregates.md %}#array_aggarg):

```sql
SELECT month, month_name, array_agg(station) AS top3_stations
FROM (
    SELECT
        month,
        strftime(make_date(2023, month, 1), '%B') AS month_name,
        rank() OVER
            (PARTITION BY month ORDER BY num_services DESC) AS rank,
        station,
        num_services
    FROM services_per_month
    WHERE month BETWEEN 6 AND 8
)
WHERE rank <= 3
GROUP BY ALL
ORDER BY month;
```

This gives the following result:

| month | month_name |                        top3_stations                         |
|------:|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 6     | June       | [Utrecht Centraal, Amsterdam Centraal, Schiphol Airport]     |
| 7     | July       | [Utrecht Centraal, Amsterdam Centraal, Schiphol Airport]     |
| 8     | August     | [Utrecht Centraal, Amsterdam Centraal, Amsterdam Sloterdijk] |

We can see that the top 3 spots are shared between four stations: Utrecht Centraal, Amsterdam Centraal, Schiphol Airport, and Amsterdam Sloterdijk.

### Directly Querying Parquet Files through HTTPS or S3

DuckDB supports querying remote files, including CSV and Parquet, via [the HTTP(S) protocol and the S3 API]({% link docs/extensions/httpfs/overview.md %}).
For example, we can run the following query:

```sql
SELECT "Service:Date", "Stop:Station name"
FROM 'https://blobs.duckdb.org/nl-railway/services-2023.parquet'
LIMIT 3;
```

It returns the following result:

| Service:Date | Stop:Station name  |
|--------------|--------------------|
| 2023-01-01   | Rotterdam Centraal |
| 2023-01-01   | Delft              |
| 2023-01-01   | Den Haag HS        |

Using the remote Parquet file, the query for answering [_Which are the top-3 busiest stations for each summer month?_](#finding-the-top-3-busiest-stations-for-each-summer-month) can be run directly on a remote Parquet file without creating any local tables.
To do this, we can define the `services_per_month` table as a [common table expression in the `WITH` clause]({% link docs/sql/query_syntax/with.md %}).
The rest of the query remains the same:

```sql
WITH services_per_month AS (
    SELECT
        month("Service:Date") AS month,
        "Stop:Station name" AS station,
        count(*) AS num_services
    FROM 'https://blobs.duckdb.org/nl-railway/services-2023.parquet'
    GROUP BY ALL
)
SELECT month, month_name, array_agg(station) AS top3_stations
FROM (
    SELECT
        month,
        strftime(make_date(2023, month, 1), '%B') AS month_name,
        rank() OVER
            (PARTITION BY month ORDER BY num_services DESC) AS rank,
        station,
        num_services
    FROM services_per_month
    WHERE month BETWEEN 6 AND 8
)
WHERE rank <= 3
GROUP BY ALL
ORDER BY month;
```

This query yields the same result as the query above, and completes (depending on the network speed) in about 1–2 seconds.
This speed is possible because DuckDB doesn't need to download the whole Parquet file to evaluate the query:
while the file size is 309&nbsp;MB, it only uses about 20&nbsp;MB of network traffic, approximately 6% of the total file size.

The reduction in network traffic is possible because of [partial reading]({% link docs/data/parquet/overview.md %}#partial-reading) along both the columns and the rows of the data.
First, Parquet's columnar layout allows the reader to only access the required columns.
Second, the [zonemaps]({% link docs/guides/performance/indexing.md %}#zonemaps) available in the Parquet file's metadata allow the filter pushdown optimization (e.g., the reader only fetches [row groups]({% link docs/internals/storage.md %}#row-groups) with dates in the summer months).
Both of these optimizations are implemented via [HTTP range requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests),
saving considerable traffic and time when running queries on remote Parquet files.

## Largest Distance between Train Stations in the Netherlands

Let's answer the following question: _Which two train stations in the Netherlands have the largest distance between them when traveling via rail?_
For this, we'll use two datasets.
The first, [`stations-2022-01.csv`](https://blobs.duckdb.org/data/stations-2022-01.csv), contains information on the [railway stations](https://www.rijdendetreinen.nl/en/open-data/stations) (station name, country, etc.). We can simply load and query this dataset as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE stations AS
    FROM 'https://blobs.duckdb.org/data/stations-2022-01.csv';

SELECT
    id,
    name_short,
    name_long,
    country,
    printf('%.2f', geo_lat) AS latitude,
    printf('%.2f', geo_lng) AS longitude
FROM stations
LIMIT 5;
```

| id  | name_short |       name_long       | country | latitude | longitude |
|----:|------------|-----------------------|---------|----------|-----------|
| 266 | Den Bosch  | 's-Hertogenbosch      | NL      | 51.69    | 5.29      |
| 269 | Dn Bosch O | 's-Hertogenbosch Oost | NL      | 51.70    | 5.32      |
| 227 | 't Harde   | 't Harde              | NL      | 52.41    | 5.89      |
| 8   | Aachen     | Aachen Hbf            | D       | 50.77    | 6.09      |
| 818 | Aachen W   | Aachen West           | D       | 50.78    | 6.07      |

The second dataset, [`tariff-distances-2022-01.csv`](https://blobs.duckdb.org/data/tariff-distances-2022-01.csv), contains the [station distances](https://www.rijdendetreinen.nl/en/open-data/station-distances). The distances are defined as the shortest route on the railway network and they are used to calculate the tariffs for ticket.
Let's peek into this file:

```bash
head -n 9 tariff-distances-2022-01.csv | cut -d, -f1-9
```

```csv
Station,AC,AH,AHP,AHPR,AHZ,AKL,AKM,ALM
AC,XXX,82,83,85,90,71,188,32
AH,82,XXX,1,3,8,77,153,98
AHP,83,1,XXX,2,9,78,152,99
AHPR,85,3,2,XXX,11,80,150,101
AHZ,90,8,9,11,XXX,69,161,106
AKL,71,77,78,80,69,XXX,211,96
AKM,188,153,152,150,161,211,XXX,158
ALM,32,98,99,101,106,96,158,XXX
```

We can see that the distances are encoded as a matrix with the diagonal entries set to `XXX`.
As explained in the [dataset's description](https://www.rijdendetreinen.nl/en/open-data/station-distances#description), this string implies that the two stations are the same station.
If we just load the values as `XXX`, the CSV reader will assume that all columns have the type `VARCHAR` instead of numeric values.
While this can be cleaned up later, it's a lot easier to avoid this problem altogether.
To do so, we use the `read_csv` function and set the [`nullstr` parameter]({% link docs/data/csv/overview.md %}#parameters) to `XXX`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE distances AS
    FROM read_csv(
        'https://blobs.duckdb.org/data/tariff-distances-2022-01.csv',
        nullstr = 'XXX'
    );
```

To make the `NULL` values visible in the command line output, we set the [`.nullvalue` dot command]({% link docs/api/cli/dot_commands.md %}) to `NULL`:

```sql
.nullvalue NULL
```

Then, using the [`DESCRIBE` statement]({% link docs/guides/meta/describe.md %}), we can confirm that DuckDB has inferred the column correctly as `BIGINT`:

```sql
FROM (DESCRIBE distances)
LIMIT 5;
```

| column_name | column_type | null | key  | default | extra |
|-------------|-------------|------|------|---------|-------|
| Station     | VARCHAR     | YES  | NULL | NULL    | NULL  |
| AC          | BIGINT      | YES  | NULL | NULL    | NULL  |
| AH          | BIGINT      | YES  | NULL | NULL    | NULL  |
| AHP         | BIGINT      | YES  | NULL | NULL    | NULL  |
| AHPR        | BIGINT      | YES  | NULL | NULL    | NULL  |

To show the first 9 columns, we can run the following query with the [`#1`, `#2`, etc. column indexes in the `SELECT` statement]({% link docs/sql/statements/select.md %}):

```sql
SELECT #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9
FROM distances
LIMIT 8;
```

| Station |  AC  |  AH  | AHP  | AHPR | AHZ  | AKL  | AKM  | ALM  |
|---------|------|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|
| AC      | NULL | 82   | 83   | 85   | 90   | 71   | 188  | 32   |
| AH      | 82   | NULL | 1    | 3    | 8    | 77   | 153  | 98   |
| AHP     | 83   | 1    | NULL | 2    | 9    | 78   | 152  | 99   |
| AHPR    | 85   | 3    | 2    | NULL | 11   | 80   | 150  | 101  |
| AHZ     | 90   | 8    | 9    | 11   | NULL | 69   | 161  | 106  |
| AKL     | 71   | 77   | 78   | 80   | 69   | NULL | 211  | 96   |
| AKM     | 188  | 153  | 152  | 150  | 161  | 211  | NULL | 158  |
| ALM     | 32   | 98   | 99   | 101  | 106  | 96   | 158  | NULL |

We can see that the data was loaded correctly but the wide table format is a bit unwieldy for further processing:
to query for pairs of stations, we need to first turn it into a long table using the [`UNPIVOT`]({% link docs/sql/statements/unpivot.md %}) statement.
Naïvely, we would write something like the following:

```sql
CREATE TABLE distances_long AS
    UNPIVOT distances
    ON AC, AH, AHP, ...
```

However, we have almost 400 stations, so spelling out their names would be quite tedious.
Fortunately, DuckDB has a trick to help with this:
the [`COLUMNS(*)` expression]({% link docs/sql/expressions/star.md %}#columns-expression) lists all columns
and its optional `EXCLUDE` modifier can remove given column names from the list.
Therefore, the expression `COLUMNS(* EXCLUDE station)` lists all column names except `station`, precisely what we need for the `UNPIVOT` command:

```sql
CREATE TABLE distances_long AS
    UNPIVOT distances
    ON COLUMNS (* EXCLUDE station)
    INTO NAME other_station VALUE distance;
```

This results in the following table:

```sql
SELECT station, other_station, distance
FROM distances_long
LIMIT 3;
```

| Station | other_station | distance |
|---------|---------------|---------:|
| AC      | AH            | 82       |
| AC      | AHP           | 83       |
| AC      | AHPR          | 85       |

Now we can join the `distances_long` table on the `stations` table along both the start and end stations,
then filter for stations which are located in the Netherlands.
We introduce symmetry breaking (`station < other_station`) to ensure that the same pair of stations only occurs once in the output.
Finally, we select the top-3 results:

```sql
SELECT
    s1.name_long AS station1,
    s2.name_long AS station2,
    distances_long.distance
FROM distances_long
JOIN stations s1 ON distances_long.station = s1.code
JOIN stations s2 ON distances_long.other_station = s2.code
WHERE s1.country = 'NL'
  AND s2.country = 'NL'
  AND station < other_station
ORDER BY distance DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

The results show that there are pairs of train stations, which are at least 425 km away – quite the distance for such a small country!

|     station1     |      station2      | distance |
|------------------|--------------------|---------:|
| Eemshaven        | Vlissingen         | 426      |
| Eemshaven        | Vlissingen Souburg | 425      |
| Bad Nieuweschans | Vlissingen         | 425      |

## Conclusion

In this post, we demonstrated some of DuckDB's key features,
including
[automatic detection of formats based on filenames]({% link docs/data/overview.md %}),
[auto-inferencing the schema of CSV files]({% post_url 2023-10-27-csv-sniffer %}),
[direct Parquet querying]({% post_url 2021-06-25-querying-parquet %}),
[remote querying]({% link docs/extensions/httpfs/overview.md %}),
[window functions]({% post_url 2021-10-13-windowing %}),
[unpivot]({% link docs/sql/statements/unpivot.md %}),
[several friendly SQL features]({% link docs/sql/dialect/friendly_sql.md %}) (such as `FROM`-first, `GROUP BY ALL`, and `COLUMNS(*)`),
and so on.
The combination of these allows for formulating queries using different file formats (CSV, Parquet), data sources (local, HTTPS, S3), and SQL features.
This helps users answer queries quickly and efficiently.

In the next installment, we'll take a look at
temporal data using [AsOf joins]({% post_url 2023-09-15-asof-joins-fuzzy-temporal-lookups %})
and
geospatial data using the DuckDB [`spatial` extension]({% post_url 2023-04-28-spatial %}).
